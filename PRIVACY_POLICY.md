# Privacy Policy for Flexecution

**Last Updated: February 15, 2026**

## Overview

Flexecution ("the App") is a workout tracking, planning, and daily health logging application. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we handle your information.

## Data Collection and Storage

**We do not collect any personal data.**

All information you enter into Flexecution is stored locally on your device only. This includes:

- Workout logs, exercises, and set data
- Personal records and achievements
- Workout templates and scheduled workouts
- Auto-generated workout programs (linear and double progression)
- Daily health logs including body weight, body fat percentage, muscle mass, and body circumferences (chest, waist, hips, biceps, thighs, calves, neck, shoulders)
- Wellness metrics including sleep, energy, mood, stress, water intake, calories, and protein
- Daily notes and progress tracking
- Custom exercise names and icons

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with anyone.**

- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No data is shared with third parties
- No analytics or tracking services are used
- No advertising networks are integrated

## No Account Required

Flexecution works entirely offline. You do not need to create an account, provide an email address, or sign in to use the App.

## Data Export, Import, and Sharing

You have full control over your data:

- **Export**: You can export your workout data as a JSON file at any time through the Settings menu
- **Import**: You can import previously exported workout data
- **Calendar Export**: You can export workouts to your device's calendar using Apple's EventKit framework or as shareable ICS files. This requires your permission to access the Calendar and only writes data you choose to export.
- **Share**: You can share exported ICS files via the iOS share sheet (AirDrop, Messages, Mail, etc.). No data is sent to any server — sharing is handled entirely by the operating system.
- **Delete**: You can clear all data from the App through Settings

## Device Permissions

The App may request the following permissions, which are optional and only used when you initiate the related feature:

- **Calendar Access**: Required only when you choose to export workouts to your device's calendar. No calendar data is read or collected by the App.
- **Notifications**: Required only when you enable workout reminders, streak reminders, or weekly recaps in Settings. Notifications are generated locally on your device and are not transmitted to any server.

## In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

Flexecution offers optional premium subscriptions. All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID credentials. Subscription management, including cancellation and renewal, is handled through your Apple ID settings.

## Third-Party Services

Flexecution does not integrate with any third-party services. The App does not connect to cloud storage, social media, analytics providers, advertising networks, or health data platforms. The only external communication is through Apple's StoreKit framework for subscription management, which is handled entirely by Apple.

## Data Security

Your data is stored using Apple's SwiftData framework on your device. Security is protected by device passcode/biometrics, iOS/iPadOS data protection, and app sandboxing.

## Children's Privacy

Flexecution does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
